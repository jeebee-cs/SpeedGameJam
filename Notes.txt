- Right now player can still move after death
- Player face movement direction

- scale of game (size of guards, static objects ... )
- timer (counting down or up?)

- Patroling guard?
- lerp laser & cone length
- sleeping

player can get stuck right now (qa testing)

toom todo
- improve main menu
- implement patroling guard (as a test, see what others think)
- for testing vision on player?

- you can pass through the sleeping guards
- you can collide with guards. (maybe idea for feature if we have more time: collision with walls make noise -> draw attention of guards)
- test running normal, with shift, with space

Added smooth navigation between scenes. Added target indicators. 

Idea for leaderboard:
make wanted posters leader board main screen (rewarding for players who are on the leaderboard)
in leaderboard screen show player result and neighbouring results (may feel bad for the player to play but not receive a ranking)
